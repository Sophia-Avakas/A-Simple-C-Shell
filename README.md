# A Simple C Shell
<br>I implemented several new features in a simplified xv6 shell with Unix system call interface. The simplified shell contains two main parts: parsing shell commands and implementing them. The parser recognizes only simple shell commands. 
<br>
<br>The features I extended include ls, I/O redirection commands and pipes.
